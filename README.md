High population density areas, such as apartments in urban areas, near street traffic and airports, suffer from noise pollution. For example, much of New York City experiences an average of 73.4 dBA at street level. Excess noise can cause adverse health effects; the World Health Organization recommends less than 40dBA at night to prevent adverse health effects from noise affecting quality sleep [3], and the Center for Disease Control notes that noise above 70dBA experienced over a prolonged period of time can cause hearing loss [1].

Currently, the only widely available solution to diminishing noise pollution in open areas is Passive Noise Cancellation (PNC) through physical objects such as sound-insulating walls, mufflers, etc [2]. Because of the physical limitations due to the physics of sound, Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) has been applied for reducing sounds of low frequencies below 1 kHz, while PNC has been applied for reducing sounds of high frequencies above 1 kHz.  

ANC is used in specific, specialized areas in which the entire volume will be affected by the sound of the speaker(s) such as in earphones/headphones, cars, airplanes, HVAC systems, etc.

The objective of this senior capstone project is to develop a speaker using ANC capabilities that will diminish excess noise both for the health and comfort of city apartment residents.
